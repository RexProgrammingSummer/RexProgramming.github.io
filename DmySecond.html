    <h1 style="color:ffc0cb;font-family:verdana;font-size:250%;"> This is my second web page in less than 3 hours! </h1>
      <p style="color:b0e0e6;font-family:times new roman; font-size:275%;"> This is definitely the most phenomenal thing in my life. Especially this. The fact that I am creating a pedometer then patenting it and putting ads inside. This is sure to make me billions of dollars. 
So this means 3 garages, so 6 cars. 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO for $52000000, 1957 Ferrari 335 sport for $35711359, Rolls royce solid phantom gold for $8500000, 2012 Lexus LFA for $375000, 2016 Lamborghini Aventador for $399500, then a 2017 BMW i8 for $143400. 
Then wrapping. 40000 dollars per car, except the rolls royce phantom solid gold. So 97329259 dollars to lose. There is a lot of colors. The I8 is being wrapped in Chrome gold. My Aventador will be wrapped Chrome Rose gold. The LFA will be wrapped blue. The 250 GTO will be wrapped matte black, then the 335 sport matte purple.The 8.5 million dollar rolls royce phantom is perfectly fine not being wrapped cause it is white and gold, so it is already cool. My brother is perfect for the patenting, because he is a lawyer. Then a company who sells apps will put ads in it. So that is the science behind my money.
